        <p class="pabout">‘Helping students find projects’ is a project proposed by Martin Stacey that aims to provide a
            better platform for managing and viewing final year projects proposals. With the number of projects proposed
            every year finding one can be difficult for students especially when projects are uploaded to multiple media
            whether this be xlsx spreadsheets, word documents or lecturer ‘project proposal web pages.’ </p>

        <h1 class="habout">Project Aims</h1>
        <p class="pabout">This website aims to provide a web-based platform that students and lecturers can use to
            upload and view final year projects. Lectures will be able to upload their proposed projects along with
            information such as keywords, brief description of the project along with a rating of how difficult the
            project is. Students will be able to search the database of proposed projects using search parameters such
            as keywords, difficulty rating and the lecturer that proposed the project</p>
